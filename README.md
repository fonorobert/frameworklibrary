# frameworklibrary

This is a collection of frameworks and libraries I use, intend to use or think might be useful sometime in the future.

Currently the collection is categorized as follows:

- [front-end JavaScript](frontendjs.md)
- [front-end UI](frontendui.md)
- [back-end](backend.md)
- [guides and tutorials](guides.md)


A great and exhaustive collection of front-end stuffs is found in the aptly named [frontend-stuff](https://github.com/moklick/frontend-stuff) repo.

[JavaScript The Right Way](http://jstherightway.org/) is a cool JavaScript reference.
